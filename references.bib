	abstract = {Many recent advancements in single-molecule localization microscopy exploit the stochastic photoswitching of fluorophores to reveal complex cellular structures beyond the classical diffraction limit. However, this same stochasticity makes counting the number of molecules to high precision extremely challenging, preventing key insight into the cellular structures and processes under observation.Modelling the photoswitching behaviour of a fluorophore as an unobserved continuous time Markov process transitioning between a single fluorescent and multiple dark states, and fully mitigating for missed blinks and false positives, we present a method for computing the exact probability distribution for the number of observed localizations from a single photoswitching fluorophore. This is then extended to provide the probability distribution for the number of localizations in a direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy experiment involving an arbitrary number of molecules. We demonstrate that when training data are available to estimate photoswitching rates, the unknown number of molecules can be accurately recovered from the posterior mode of the number of molecules given the number of localizations. Finally, we demonstrate the method on experimental data by quantifying the number of adapter protein linker for activation of T cells on the cell surface of the T-cell immunological synapse.Software and data available at https://github.com/lp1611/mol\_count\_dstorm.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Large and complex macromolecular assemblies—like {RNA} and {DNA} polymerases, the kinetochore, the ribosome, {ATP} synthase, and many others—are critical components of the cell. To fully characterize these molecular machines, it is not sufficient to rely solely on traditional structural methods, like cryo-{EM} and X-ray crystallography that provide great structural detail in vitro; we need experimental and theoretical tools that can describe the organization of these machines in their native cellular environment so as to better understand their function. Here we provide a strategy for extracting precisely this information directly from superresolution imaging data, a state-of-the-art technique for probing biological structures in living cells below the diffraction limit.
          , 
            Superresolution imaging methods—now widely used to characterize biological structures below the diffraction limit—are poised to reveal in quantitative detail the stoichiometry of protein complexes in living cells. In practice, the photophysical properties of the fluorophores used as tags in superresolution methods have posed a severe theoretical challenge toward achieving this goal. Here we develop a stochastic approach to enumerate fluorophores in a diffraction-limited area measured by superresolution microscopy. The method is a generalization of aggregated Markov methods developed in the ion channel literature for studying gating dynamics. We show that the method accurately and precisely enumerates fluorophores in simulated data while simultaneously determining the kinetic rates that govern the stochastic photophysics of the fluorophores to improve the prediction’s accuracy. This stochastic method overcomes several critical limitations of temporal thresholding methods.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule localization microscopy ({SMLM}) has revolutionized light microscopy by enabling optical resolution down to a few nanometer. Yet, localization precision commonly does not suffice to visually resolve single subunits in molecular assemblies or multimeric complexes. Because each targeted molecule contributes localizations during image acquisition, molecular counting approaches to reveal the target copy numbers within localization clusters have been persistently proposed since the early days of {SMLM}, most of which rely on preliminary knowledge of the dye photophysics or on a calibration to a reference. Previously, we developed localization-based fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ({lbFCS}) as an absolute ensemble counting approach for the {SMLM}-variant {DNA}-{PAINT} (points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography), for the first time, to our knowledge, circumventing the necessity for reference calibrations. Here, we present an extended concept termed {lbFCS}+, which allows absolute counting of copy numbers for individual localization clusters in a single {DNA}-{PAINT} image. In {lbFCS}+, absolute counting of fluorescent loci contained in individual nanoscopic volumes is achieved via precise measurement of the local hybridization rates of the fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides (“imagers”) employed in {DNA}-{PAINT} imaging. In proof-of-principle experiments on {DNA} origami nanostructures, we demonstrate the ability of {lbFCS}+ to truthfully determine molecular copy numbers and imager association and dissociation rates in well-separated localization clusters containing up to 10 docking strands. For N ≤ 4 target molecules, {lbFCS}+ is even able to resolve integers, providing the potential to study the composition of up to tetrameric molecular complexes. Furthermore, we show that {lbFCS}+ allows resolving heterogeneous binding dynamics, enabling the distinction of stochastically generated and a priori indistinguishable {DNA} assemblies. Beyond advancing quantitative {DNA}-{PAINT} imaging, we believe that {lbFCS}+ could find promising applications ranging from biosensing to {DNA} computing.},

Here we use fluorescence correlation spectroscopy calibrated live imaging of endogenously fluorescently tagged nucleoporins to map the changes in the composition and stoichiometry of seven major modules of the human {NPC} during its assembly in single dividing cells. This systematic quantitative map reveals that the two assembly pathways have distinct molecular mechanisms, in which the order of addition of two large structural components, the central ring complex and nuclear filaments are inverted. The dynamic stoichiometry data was integrated to create a spatiotemporal model of the {NPC} assembly pathway and predict the structures of postmitotic {NPC} assembly intermediates.},

Once the correct relationship has been determined, basis histograms can be generated from the single-molecule intensity distribution to fit the puncta distribution. Simulated data were used to demonstrate procedures to determine this relationship, and to test the methodology. This method has the advantages of single-molecule measurements, providing both the mean and variation in molecules per puncta. This methodology has been tested with the avidin-biocytin binding system for which the best-fit distribution of biocytins in the sample puncta was in good agreement with a bulk determination of the avidin-biocytin binding ratio.},
