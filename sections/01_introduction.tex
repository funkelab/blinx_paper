\section{Introduction}


% Challenges of fluorescence microscopy
Fluorescence microscopy is a foundational tool in the field of biology,
  providing essential information on the presence and localization 
  of labeled structures.
%
    However, often in biology, localization is only the first step,
    and a deeper understanding of the system requires more precise
    quantitative information, such as molecular count. 
    %
    One example of the importance of molecular count is found in the microclusters 
    that initiate T cell activation, where intercelluar
    signal strength is controled by the number of proteins in the microcluster.
    %
    Another example is in focal adhesions, where the traction force generated is a function of the stoicheometry 
    of different integrins within the adhesion. 
    %
    Accurate molecular counting, will deepen our understanding of these and other processes where absolute count, 
    and stoicheometery play important roles in biological function.

% Sometimes we can visually seperate structures,
% but often they are too close together
When the labeled structures of interest are large, such as cells organelles, or other large complexes,
  they can be spatially separated, and precise counting becomes trivial.
  However many structures are smaller than the diffraction limited resolution of 200 - 250 nm.
%
% While we cant separate spatially, we can temporally
While these small structures can no longer be directly spatially resolved, many super-resolution % not all 
  imaging techniques utilize stochastic blinking to seperate these structures in time,
  and reconstuct a composite with a resolution well below the diffraction limit. 
  %
  PALM, and STORM, and other single-molecule localization microscopy techniques
  have been shown to achieve resolutions as high as 5-30 nm.
  % Even with this separation there are things that are smaller
  However, there are still smaller structures such as sub-complexes, individual monomers, that 
  cannot be seperated and quantified with these techniques.
  %Transition: new methods of molecular counting are needed
  To quantify the number of objects in this smallest regime, methods must be developed that no longer rely on spatial seperation.

% Overview of other counting methods
Perhaps the simplest method of molecular counting is correlating fluorescent
    intensity with the number of labels\todo{labels, fluorophores, binding sites: let's decide on one and be consistent (I vote for binding sites)}, \ie the brighter it is, the more there are.
    %
    This method works well for qualitative measures, but lacks the precision needed 
    to report exact counts\todo{good and true, but why?}.
    % temporal information is useful for counting
    Similar to PALM and STORM, molecular counting methods can make use of temporal information
    to achieve higher precision.
    % utilize random fluctuations
    Methods such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and 
    balanced super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (bSOFI)
    utilize random fluctuations in fluorescent intensity over time to estimate the molecular count.
    % structured fluctuations in time are even more useful
    Using blinking fluorophores, a predictable structure can be introduced 
    to the intensity fluctuations, boosting the performance of counting algorithms.
    % limited by bleaching (re-write this!)
    However, these models are limited by the complex behaviour of the fluorophores and their
    tendency to photobleach after a few blinking cycles. \todo{mention PC-PALM somewhere}


% DNA-PAINT is extra useful because its emitters dont bleach either
In contrast, DNA-PAINT is a method of producing blinking fluorescence that is functionally
    immune to photobleaching due to the continuous replenishment of fluorophores from solution.
    % lbFCS
    Localization based FCS (lbFCS), combines the structured blinking of DNA-PAINT, with the 
    principles of FCS, fitting the autocorrelation function of intensity over time to produce a count,
    and is able to count up to 6 molecules in a single diffraction limited spot.
    % qPAINT
    Quantitative DNA-PAINT (qPAINT) estiamtes the molecular count based on the frequency of blinking events, \ie, 
    a blinking rate of 1 event per second is calibrated to 1 molecule, therefore an obervation of 10 events per second
    produces a count of 10 molecules.
    % Limitations
    Both of these methods are limited in that they fit summary statistics,
    rather than the data directly. 
    %
    Further, all of the methods mentioned provide a single estimate of molecular count.
    A well calibrated probabilistic estimate would provide 
    
% Our Model
% ----------
% fully Bayesian
We propose \ours, a fully Bayesian model to estimate the molecular 
  count directly from a fluctuating sequence of fluorescent intensity measurements over time.
  % Based on a fully differentiable markov chain
  Based on a fully differentiable Hidden Markov Model, \ours fits 7 parameters
  directly to the sequence of measurements, estimating a likelihood for each possible count. 
  % probabilistic
  These likelihoods can be directly compared, producing a posterior distribution of counts 
  given the observation sequence. 
  % more accurate than existing methods 

Here we first validate \ours on simualted experiments. Next
