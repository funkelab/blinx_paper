\section{Method}

Starting from the photo-physics of the system, we derive a probabilistic model,
accounting for both the observed intensity, and the temporal fluctuation
kinetics.
  %
  Given an intensity trace, the output of our method \ours is the posterior
  distribution over molecular counts, providing not only the most likely count,
  but also a comparison to all other possible counts. 

\subsection{Model}

We consider the case of multiple fluorescent emitters within a single
diffraction limited spot.
%
  As such, we can only measure their combined intensity contributions
  $\x{t}$ at a timepoint $t$.
  %
  We assume that each emitter blinks stochastically and independently of the
  others, yielding a fluctuating trace $\trace = (\x{1},\ldots,\x{T})$ of total
  intensity measurements over $T$ frames (see an example in
  \figref{fig:method:overview}a).
  %
  Our goal now is to infer the number of emitters \n, given \trace.

More formally, we are interested in modelling a posterior distribution of the
number of emitters given the intensity trace, \ie:
  %
  \begin{equation*}
    p(\n | \trace) \propto p(n) p(\trace | \n)
  \end{equation*}
  %
  % Can ignore p(n)
  Assuming a uniform prior on the number of emitters, $p(\n)$ can be ignored
  and it remains to model the likelihood $p(\trace|\n)$.
  %
  % choose to model as HMM
  %
  We model this likelihood as a \hmm where the hidden state, denoted by \z{t},
  represents the number of emitters that are active and emitting photons at
  time $t$ (see \figref{fig:method:overview}d).
  %
  The whole \hmm is conditioned on several parameters \parameters, (
    \parametersc: camera parameters, \parameterse: emission parameters, 
    and \parameterst: transition parameters).
  %
  \begin{equation}
    p(\trace| \n, \parameters) =
      \prod_{t=1}^{T}
        p(\x{t} | \z{t}, \parameters)
        p(\z{t} | \z{t-1}, \parameters, \n)
    \text{,}
    \label{eq:method:HMM}
  \end{equation}
  %
  where we define $p(\z{1}|\z{0},\parameters,\n)=p(\z{}|\parameters,\n)$, \ie,
  the initial distribution of the hidden state $\z{}$ is the stationary
  distribution.

  Following this framework, the likelihood is the product of two probability
  distributions: an intensity model $p(\x{t}|\z{t},\parameters)$ and a
  transition model $p(\z{t}|\z{t-1},\parameters,\n)$.

\subsubsection{Intensity Model}

The distribution of observed intensity measurements \x{t} given the number of
currently active emitters \z{t} can be directly derived from the photo-physics
of our microscope system.
  %
  (Note that in the following section we omit the subscript $t$ for clarity.)
  %
  Working backwards through the light path, the measured intensity value \x{}
  is a function of the number of photons \photons detected
  (\figref{fig:method:overview}c).
  %
  The detector itself contributes noise to the system, known as the readout
  noise, which we model as $p(\x{}|\photons,\parametersc)$.
  %
  The number of photons hitting the detector, in turn, depend on the number of
  active emitters \z{} and are distributed following a shot noise model
  $p(\photons|\z{},\parameterse)$.

The probability of observing an intensity \x{} given \z{} can then be obtained
by marginalizing over \photons, \ie:
  %
  \begin{equation}
    p(\x{}|\z{},\parameters) =
      \sum_\photons
        \underbrace{p(\x{}|\photons,\parametersc)}_{\text{readout}}
        \underbrace{p(\photons|\z{},\parameterse)}_{\text{shot}}
    \text{.}
    \label{eq:method:marginalized_intensity}
  \end{equation}

\paragraph{Readout Noise}

The readout noise from the detector is often assumed to be negligible (\ie when
using an EMCCD camera).
  %
  However, when using an sCMOS camera, it's contribution is significant and 
  must be accounted for~\citep{huang_video-rate_2013}.
  %
  To accommodate both systems, here we include the readout noise in our model.
  %
  Given \photons photons, the readout intensity of the camera is normally
  distributed~\citep{huang_video-rate_2013}
  %
  \begin{equation}
    p(\x{}|\photons,\parametersc) = \mathcal{N}[\photons\camgain + \camoffset, \camvar](\x{})
    \text{,}
  \end{equation}
  %
  where $\parametersc = (\camgain, \camoffset, \camvar)$ are the camera's gain,
  offset, and variance, respectively.

  In the following, it will be beneficial to express the readout noise as a
  zero mean normal distribution that is independent of the number of photons
  detected. To that end, we transform our measurements \x{} into photon space
  by accounting for the camera gain and offset:
  %
  \begin{equation}
    \xp{} = \frac{\x{} - \camoffset}{\camgain}
    \;\;\;\;
    \x{} = \xp{}\camgain + \camoffset
    \text{.}
  \end{equation}
  %
  We can now express our readout noise distribution in terms of the transformed
  measurements \xp{}, which we further shift by $-\photons$ to obtain a
  zero-mean distribution:
  %
  \begin{align}
    p(\xp{}|\photons,\parametersc)
      &= \mathcal{N}[\photons, \frac{\camvar}{\camgain^2}](\xp{})  \\
      &= \mathcal{N}[0, \frac{\camvar}{\camgain^2}](\xp{} - \photons)
      \label{eq:method:transformed_readout_noise}
    \text{.}
  \end{align}

\paragraph{Shot Noise}

Due to shot noise, the number of photons detected over a time interval
$\deltat$ is Poisson distributed~\cite{mehta_poisson_2016}
(\figref{fig:method:overview}c).
  %
  Our model accounts for two sources of emitted photons: first, the \z{} active
  emitters produce photons at a rate $\z{}\re$, and second, out of plane
  emitters produce a relatively constant amount of background photons \rb.
  %
  Combined, these sources produce the expected number of photons
  $\lambda=(\z{}\re + \rb)\deltat$ per frame.
  %
  \begin{equation}
    p(\photons|\z{},\parameterse)
      = \poisson[\underbrace{(\z{}\re + \rb)\deltat}_{\lambda}](\photons)
    \text{.}
  \end{equation}
  %
  For large values of $\lambda$ the Poisson distribution approaches a normal
  distribution with both mean and variance of $\lambda$ and therefore we
  approximate our shot noise distribution as:
  %
  \begin{equation}
    p(\photons|\z{},\parameterse)
      \approx \mathcal{N}[\lambda, \lambda](\photons)
    \text{.}
    \label{eq:method:normal_approx_shot_noise}
  \end{equation}

\paragraph{Combined Intensity Model}

Taking together the measurement transform
\eqref{eq:method:transformed_readout_noise} and approximation ~\eqref{eq:method:normal_approx_shot_noise}, the
intensity distribution \eqref{eq:method:marginalized_intensity} can now be
rewritten as
%
  \begin{equation}
    p(\xp{}|\z{},\parametersc, \parameterse)
      = \sum_\photons
        \mathcal{N}[0, \frac{\camvar}{\camgain^2}](\xp{} - \photons)
        \mathcal{N}[\lambda, \lambda](\photons)
    \text{.}
  \end{equation}
  %
  Similar to~\cite{huang_video-rate_2013}, we note that this expression
  resembles a convolution, \ie, the sum of two independent random variables
  (the photon count \photons and a zero-mean, photon-independent camera readout
  noise, see~\eqref{eq:method:transformed_readout_noise}). Since the two distributions are normal, we can rewrite
  the above as a single normal distribution with summed means and variances:
  %
  \begin{equation}
    p(\xp{}|\z{},\parametersc, \parameterse)
      = \mathcal{N}[\lambda, \lambda + \frac{\camvar}{\camgain^2}](\xp{})
    \text{.}
    \label{eq:method:combined_intensity}
  \end{equation}

\subsubsection{Transition Model}

Next, to model the step-like temporal fluctuations in intensity, observed in
the trace \trace, a distribution is needed that describes the change in the
number of active emitters \z{} over time.
  %
  To do this, we assume that the process is Markovian and the number of active
  emitters \z{t} at time $t$ depends only on the number of active emitters at
  the previous time point \z{t-1}.
  %
  On the individual emitter level, we define \pon as the probability of an
  inactive emitter at time $t-1$ to become active at time $t$.
  Conversely, we define \poff as the probability of an active emitter at $t-1$
  to become inactive at time $t$ (\figref{fig:method:overview}b).

For the case of a single emitter (\ie, $\n=1$), the probability of observing
this emitter as active (\ie, $\z{t}=1$) is therefore \pon if the emitter was
inactive in the previous frame, or $(1-\poff)$ if it was previously active
(and similarly for the probability of observing the emitter as inactive).
  %
  For multiple emitters, however, a transition from \z{t-1} to \z{t} can be
  caused by multiple events. Consider, for example the case of two emitters
  ($\n=2$). A transition from $\z{t-1}=1$ to $\z{t}=1$ can either be caused by
  no change occurring at all or one emitter activating while the other
  deactivates.

In the general case ($\n\geq1$), we consider all possible events that can
lead to an observed change in \z{}. To that end, we marginalize over the
number $a$ of active emitters that deactivated from $t-1$ to $t$:
  %
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:method:transition}
    p(z_{t} = z | z_{t-1}, \theta_{T}, n) &=\\
    \sum_{a = 0}^{z_{t-1}}
      {a \choose z_{t-1}}
      &\poff
      {z - z_{t-1} + a \choose \n - z_{t-1}}
      \pon
      \text{,} \notag
  \end{align}
  %
  Note that we assume that all emitters share the same \pon and \poff, and that
  both remain constant over time.

\subsubsection{Inference}

The likelihood $p(\trace|\parameters,\n)$ of observing \trace, see
\eqref{eq:method:HMM}, depends on a total of seven fittable parameters
\parameters and the total number of emitters \n.
  %
  However, we are interested in the posterior distribution $p(\trace|\n)$.
  Which accounting for the priors on \parameters in addition to the likelihood, 
  is known as the model evidence, and defined as:
  %
  \begin{equation*}
    p(\trace | n) = \int p(\trace | \theta, n) p(\theta | n) d\theta
    \text{.}
  \end{equation*}
  %
  Unfortunately, no closed form solution exists for this integral. We therefore
  approximate the integral using the Laplace approximation, which is the
  maximum likelihood solution corrected by the Occam
  factor~\citep{bishop_pattern_2006}:
  %
  \begin{equation}
    \ln p(\trace | n) \approx
      \ln p(\trace | \parametersmap, \n) +
      \underbrace{O(\trace, \parametersmap)}_\text{Occam factor}
    \text{,}
    \label{eq:method:evidence_with_m}
  \end{equation}
  %
  where the Occam factor $O(\trace, \parametersmap)$ is defined as
  %
  \begin{align*}
    O(\trace, \parametersmap) &=
      \ln p(\parametersmap) +
      \frac{M}{2} \ln(2\pi) -
      \frac{1}{2} \ln |A|
    \\
    A &=
      -\nabla \nabla \ln p(\parametersmap | \trace)
    \text{.}
  \end{align*}
  %
  Here, $M$ is the dimensionality of \parameters, which is constant.
  %
  Therefore this term becomes a constant and can be dropped from
  \eqref{eq:method:evidence_with_m}, resulting in:
  \begin{equation}
    \ln p(\trace | \n) \approx \ln p(\trace | \parametersmap, \n) + \ln p(\parametersmap) - \frac{1}{2} \ln |A|
    \text{.}
    \label{eq:method:evidence}
  \end{equation}
  %
  Therefore, to estimate the posterior distribution over \n we first need to 
  find the maximum likelihood parameters $\parametersmap$ for each value of \n. 

  This model is implemented fully differentiably, allowing us to estimate 
  the maximum likelihood parameters through gradient ascent. Accounting for 
  both the likelihood function and the priors, the gradients with respect to 
  \parameters are calculated as:
  %
  \begin{align}
    \text{grad} = \nabla f(\pon, \poff, \re, \rb, \camoffset, \camvar, \camgain) \\
    f(\parameters, \n) = \ln p(\trace | \parameters, \n) + \ln p(\parameters) \notag
    \text{,}
  \end{align}
  %
  and thus: 
  %
  \begin{equation}
    \ln p(\trace | \n) = \max_\parameters
    f(\parameters, \n) - \frac{1}{2} \ln |A|
    \text{.}
  \end{equation}
  %
  Finally, the molecular count can be obtained though the maximum evidence over all possible counts \n:
  %
  \begin{equation}
      \text{count} =
      \text{arg}\max_{n}
        \ln p(\trace | \n)
    \text{.}
    \label{eq:method:optimization}
  \end{equation}
