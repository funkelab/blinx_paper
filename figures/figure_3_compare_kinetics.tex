  \caption{A) the counting ability of blinx varies significantly with blinking kinetics of the emitters, showing increased model accuracy when
   $p_{on} > p_{off}$. B) When $p_{on} < p_{off}$ the distribution of observed z states is shifted towards 0 C) When $p_{on} > p_{off}$ the 
   distribution of z states is shifted towards the maximum possible z state (N)}
